# Hormones-Unit-Converter
This is a GUI application that allows users to convert hormone units, made for trans women by a trans woman :)

Overview of the script:
When the script is run, it creates a window with four hormone sections: estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, and progesterone. Each section has several units to convert between and a recommended range of values.

The user enters a value and selects the original unit and the desired unit to convert to. The program then converts the value and displays the result in the new unit.

There is also a graphical representation of the converted value compared to the recommended range for each hormone. A dot on the graph indicates the converted value, and the dot's color changes to red or green depending on whether the value is outside or inside the recommended range.

The GUI also includes buttons for copying the converted result to the clipboard and for switching the original and desired units.

To run the script, You need Python and PyQt5. As long as your operating system has both of these installed, you can run the program.

To get PyQt5, you need to have Python installed. Once you have Python, you can use the command prompt to install PyQt5 with this command:
pip install PyQt5

Enjoy :D
