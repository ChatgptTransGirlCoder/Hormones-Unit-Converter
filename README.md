# Hormones-Unit-Converter
This is a user-friendly GUI application that allows users to convert hormone units, made for anyone trans by a trans woman :)

**Features:**

**# Hormone sections: Estradiol, Testosterone, Prolactin, and Progesterone.**

**# Multiple units to convert between in each hormone section.**

**# Recommended range of values for each hormone.**

**# Conversion of values from the original unit to the desired unit, with the option to switch the original and desired units.**

**# Graphical representation of the converted value compared to the recommended range.**

**# Copying of the converted result to the clipboard.**

**Running the script:**

To run the script, you have two options. **Easier option**, you can download and run the **pre-made .exe file** from the **Releases** page. Second option, you can run the program yourself, but you will need to have **Python** and **PyQt5** installed on your computer.

First, download the **HormonesConverter.py** file by clicking on the green **"<> Code"** button, and clicking **Download as ZIP**, extract the folder and move the **HormonesConverter.py** to where you want it to be. Then, install Python, you can find the download at **https://www.python.org/downloads/** . To get **PyQt5**, you need to have Python installed. Once you have Python, you can use the command prompt (type cmd into search) to install PyQt5 with this command:
pip install PyQt5

Enjoy :D
